\section{Introduction}




\section{Combining Inferences About Multiple Objects}
Consider a sample of $N$ objects, each of which has parameters $\theta_i$.
The inference about object $i$ is described by a posterior distribution
\begin{eqnarray}
p(\theta_i | x_i) \propto \pi(\theta_i)p(x_i | \theta_i)\label{eq:individual}
\end{eqnarray}
We shall assume that this inference was carried out individually
on each object $i$, all using a common prior $\pi(\theta_i)$. Rather than
analysing all objects together, which can be very computationally expensive,
we can use the posterior distributions from Equation~\ref{eq:individual}
to reconstruct the results that would be obtained if we did analyse all
objects together.

In a hierarchical model, the posterior distribution for
$\btheta = \{\theta_1, ..., \theta_N\}$ and some hyperparameters $\alpha$
given the data 
$\bx = \{x_1, ..., x_N\}$
should actually be
\begin{eqnarray}
p(\alpha, \btheta | \bx) &\propto&
p(\alpha)p(\btheta|\alpha)p(\bx | \btheta, \alpha)\\
&=& p(\alpha)\prod_{i=1}^N f(\theta_i|\alpha)p(x_i | \theta_i)
\end{eqnarray}
